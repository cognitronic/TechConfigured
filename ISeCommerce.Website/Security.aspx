        <h3>Security Policy</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Safe and Secure Buying</b><br />
            When you shop at with us, you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make will be safe.
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL browsers, so that only we can read a buyer's personal information.
Online purchases are statistically safer than using your credit card at a restaurant or department store. Technical experts state that online purchases are far safer than traditional credit card transactions because the information is immediately encrypted into a scrambled message that can only be decrypted by an authorized computer.
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server.
In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures

            <b>We Do Not Store Credit Card Information</b><br />
            It is our company policy to not store your personal credit card information. When checking out your information is passed to a trusted 3rd party payment system to process your payment. All information passed is using a minumum of 128-bit SSL encryption.

        <p>
            <b>We Do Not Sell or Distribute Your Information</b><br />
            We respect your privacy as much as our own. We will never sell, distribute, rent or post your information. You can read our very well setup privacy policy to read the details on how we protect your information.
